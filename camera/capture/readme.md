# rs-capture Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to configure the camera for streaming and rendering Depth & RGB data to the screen.  
We use OpenGL for cross-platform rendering and GLFW for window management.  
If you are using OpenCV, `imshow` is a good alternative.

## Code Overview 

First, we include the Intel® RealSense™ Cross-Platform API.  
All but advanced functionality is provided through a single header:
```cpp
#include <librealsense2/rs.hpp> // Include RealSense Cross Platform API
```

Next, we include a [very short helper library](../example.hpp) to encapsulate OpenGL rendering and window management:
```cpp
#include "example.hpp"          // Include a short list of convenience functions for rendering
```

This header lets us easily open a new window and prepare textures for rendering.  
The `texture` class is designed to hold video frame data for rendering. 
```cpp
// Create a simple OpenGL window for rendering:
window app(1280, 720, "RealSense Capture Example");
// Declare two textures on the GPU, one for depth and one for color
texture depth_image, color_image;
```

Depth data is usually provided on a 12-bit grayscale which is not very useful for visualization.  
To enhance visualization, we provide an API that converts the grayscale image to RGB:
```cpp
// Declare depth colorizer for enhanced color visualization of depth data
rs2::colorizer color_map; 
```

The SDK API entry point is the `pipeline` class:
```cpp
// Declare the RealSense pipeline, encapsulating the actual device and sensors
rs2::pipeline pipe;
// Start streaming with the default recommended configuration
pipe.start(); 
```

Next, we wait for the next set of frames, effectively blocking the program:
```cpp
rs2::frameset data = pipe.wait_for_frames(); // Wait for next set of frames from the camera
```

Using the `frameset` object we find the first depth frame and the first color frame in the set:
```cpp
rs2::frame depth = color_map(data.get_depth_frame()); // Find and colorize the depth data
rs2::frame color = data.get_color_frame();            // Find the color data
```

Finally, depth and color rendering is implemented by the `texture` class from [example.hpp](../example.hpp)
```cpp
// Render depth on to the first half of the screen and color on to the second
depth_image.render(depth, { 0,               0, app.width() / 2, app.height() });
color_image.render(color, { app.width() / 2, 0, app.width() / 2, app.height() });
```
